# Simple blogs

This project originated from my inclination to explore design without a predetermined plan. Initially, I had no specific design ideas or outlined strategies. However, after a while, I stumbled upon a remarkably captivating design on [Figma](https://www.figma.com) by [Uchiha5555](https://github.com/uchiha5555).

This inspiration struck spontaneously. I felt compelled to incorporate the design elements I discovered on Figma into my own project.
